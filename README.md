**Floor Area Ratio Calculator**

Architects' design projects are limited by the bylaws of the site's location.
The limitations are usually provided in the ratio (1: x) where 1 is the area of the plot and x is the maximum allowed covered area and percentage of plot area for maximum ground coverage.
Though the calculations may seem simple, they usually take up a lot of time in verification and cross checking and repeating the maths.
This calculator should help architects make these necessary calculations in an efficient manner. 

This calculator is designed to help architects calculate:
  1. the maximum allowable covered area for the project
  2. the maximum allowed ground coverage for the ground floor of the building.
the calculator also seeks 'unit' input from the user to make the process user friendly and interactive.
